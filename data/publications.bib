	abstract = {Single cell genomics has become a popular approach to uncover the cellular heterogeneity of progenitor and terminally differentiated cell types with great precision. This approach can also delineate lineage hierarchies and identify molecular programmes of cell-fate acquisition and segregation. Nowadays, tens of thousands of cells are routinely sequenced in single cell-based methods and even more are expected to be analysed in the future. However, interpretation of the resulting data is challenging and requires computational models at multiple levels of abstraction. In contrast to other applications of single cell sequencing, where clustering approaches dominate, developmental systems are generally modelled using continuous structures, trajectories and trees. These trajectory models carry the promise of elucidating mechanisms of development, disease and stimulation response at very high molecular resolution. However, their reliable analysis and biological interpretation requires an understanding of their underlying assumptions and limitations. Here, we review the basic concepts of such computational approaches and discuss the characteristics of developmental processes that can be learnt from trajectory models.},

	abstract = {The cell type specific sequences of transcriptional programs during lung regeneration have remained elusive. Using time-series single cell RNA-seq of the bleomycin lung injury model, we resolved transcriptional dynamics for 28 cell types. Trajectory modeling together with lineage tracing revealed that airway and alveolar stem cells converge on a unique Krt8 + transitional stem cell state during alveolar regeneration. These cells have squamous morphology, feature p53 and NFkB activation and display transcriptional features of cellular senescence. The Krt8+ state appears in several independent models of lung injury and persists in human lung fibrosis, creating a distinct cell–cell communication network with mesenchyme and macrophages during repair. We generated a model of gene regulatory programs leading to Krt8+ transitional cells and their terminal differentiation to alveolar type-1 cells. We propose that in lung fibrosis, perturbed molecular checkpoints on the way to terminal differentiation can cause aberrant persistence of regenerative intermediate stem cell states.},

	abstract = {RNA velocity has opened up new ways of studying cellular differentiation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell’s position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.},

	abstract = {Computational trajectory inference enables the reconstruction of cell state dynamics from single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. However, trajectory inference requires that the direction of a biological process is known, largely limiting its application to differentiating systems in normal development. Here, we present CellRank (https://cellrank.org) for single-cell fate mapping in diverse scenarios, including regeneration, reprogramming and disease, for which direction is unknown. Our approach combines the robustness of trajectory inference with directional information from RNA velocity, taking into account the gradual and stochastic nature of cellular fate decisions, as well as uncertainty in velocity vectors. On pancreas development data, CellRank automatically detects initial, intermediate and terminal populations, predicts fate potentials and visualizes continuous gene expression trends along individual lineages. Applied to lineage-traced cellular reprogramming data, predicted fate probabilities correctly recover reprogramming outcomes. CellRank also predicts a new dedifferentiation trajectory during postinjury lung regeneration, including previously unknown intermediate cell states, which we confirm experimentally.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous proﬁling of single-cell gene expression and lineage history holds enormous potential for studying cellular decision making. However, it is currently unclear how lineage and gene expression information across experimental time-points can be combined in destructive in-vivo sequencing experiments. Here we present moscot-lineage, a Fused Gromov-Wasserstein based model to couple cellular proﬁles across time-points. In contrast to existing methods, moscot-lineage combines intra-individual lineage relations with inter-individual gene expression similarity. We demonstrate on simulated and real data that moscot-lineage outperforms LineageOT, the only competing approach. Further, on C. elegans embryonic development, we show how moscot-lineage, combined with existing trajectory inference methods, predicts fate probabilities and putative decision driver genes.},
