If you're an MSc or BSc student with some experience in single-cell genomics and strong coding skills in Python 🖥️, and you're looking for a research project for an internship or for your thesis, feel free to reach out! I work in Basel, Switzerland 🇨🇭🏔️, in the lab of Barbara Treutlein at the Department of Biosystem Science and Engineering of ETH Zurich. 

I work on projects that explore cellular representations and cell-cell communication from spatial genomics datasets, with a focus on organoid model systems and early human brain development 🧠. My projects involve a mix of data analysis, mathematical modeling, machine learning, and biological interpretation (and sometimes discovery 🚀). Model-wise, I work with Variational autoencoders, Vision transformers, Optimal transport, and probabilistic models in general.
