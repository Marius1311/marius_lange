Proud to share [Philipp Weiler](https://twitter.com/PhilippWeiler7)'s upcoming seminar at the [Sydney Precision Bioinformatics Alliance (SPBA)](https://twitter.com/sydneybioinfo). He will be presenting our joint work with Michal
Klein and Fabian Theis on CellRank2. Watch the talk to find out how we're improving [CellRank](https://cellrank.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
and how you might benefit from these new features. We expect to release CellRank2 in a few weeks on github.
