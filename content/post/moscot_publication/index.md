Moscot is a framework developed between the Theislab in Munich, the lab of Mor Nitzan in Jerusalem, and the group of Marco Cuturi in Paris, to enable large-scale mapping and alignment of cellular populations in time and space. For example, we map millions of cells across time points and we reconstruct spatial organization of the liver. We also showcase moscot's multimodal capacilities on a new 10x multiome pancreas dataset, generated by Lickert lab at Helmholtz Munich, where we reveal new insights into the developmental trajectories or epsilon and delta cells.
