CellRank 2, our latest work on cell-state dynamics from single-cell data, is out in [Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02303-9) and won the first [Helmholtz Software Award](https://www.hifis.net/news/2024/07/18/sw-award-final.html) in the category "Scientific originality". To date, the software has been downloaded over 120,000 times from PyPI and is used by biologists around the world to gain a deeper understanding into complex biological processes including cancer, regeneration, development and reprogramming. 

To learn more, take a look at the [press release from Helmholtz](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/newsroom/news-all/artikel/advancing-single-cell-analysis-with-cellrank-2) or read up on the [Helmholtz Sofware Awards](https://www.hifis.net/news/2024/07/18/sw-award-final.html). You find the full paper in Nature methods [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02303-9). This project was co-lead by [Philipp Weiler](https://twitter.com/PhilippWeiler7) from the [Theislab](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/research-groups/theis-lab) and myself.
