I am an [EMBO postdoctoral fellow](https://www.embo.org/funding/fellowships-grants-and-career-support/postdoctoral-fellowships/) and an associated researcher at ETH's [AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/). I am co-supervised by [Barbara Treutlein](https://bsse.ethz.ch/qdb/the-group.html) at ETH Zürich ([Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering](https://bsse.ethz.ch/)) and [Dana Pe'er](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/dana-pe-er) at MSKCC ([Computational and Systems Biology Program](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski)). 

In my research, I focus on understanding dynamical biological processes through the lens of single-cell genomics. To this end, I develop computational tools and apply them to solve biological questions that arise in processes including development, regeneration and reprogramming. In my postdoc, I'm particularly interested in studying the development of the human brain in organoid model systems, integrating spatio-temporal data across molecular modalities to understand regulatory relationships.

I have received multiple awards, grants, and scholarships, including the [Helmholtz Software Award](https://www.hifis.net/news/2024/07/18/sw-award-final.html), the [Rainer-Rudolph Prize](https://www.rainer-rudolph-stiftung.de/en/awardees/), an [Otto Bayer Fellowship](https://www.bayer-foundation.com/), a [Joachim-Herz Add-On Fellowship](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en/research/promotion-of-young-talents/add-on-fellowship-for-interdisciplinary-life-science) and an [EMBO Postdoc Fellowship](https://www.embo.org/funding/fellowships-grants-and-career-support/postdoctoral-fellowships/). 


Previously, I completed my PhD in Computational Biology (summa cum laude) in the group of [Fabian Theis](https://twitter.com/fabian_theis) at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/helmholtz-zentrum-muenchen/index.html)/[Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/), where I co-developed [CellRank](https://cellrank.org) and [moscot](https://moscot-tools.org). Both tools are used by biologists around the world to gain deeper understandings into the factors that drive cell fate decisions in health and disease.
