Hi I'm Marius; I'm an applied mathematician working at the intersection of
machine learning and molecular biology. I have recently defended my PhD in Computational Biology (summa cum laude) in the group of [Fabian Theis](https://twitter.com/fabian_theis) at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/helmholtz-zentrum-muenchen/index.html)/[Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/). I'm now working as a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of [Barbara Treutlein](https://bsse.ethz.ch/qdb/the-group.html) at ETH Zürich ([Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering](https://bsse.ethz.ch/)).

I'm interested in understanding dynamical biological processes through the lens of single-cell genomics. To this end, I develop computational tools and apply them to solve biological questions that arise in processes including development, regeneration and reprogramming. In my postdoc, I'm particularly interested in studying the development of the human brain in organoid model systems, integrating spatio-temporal data across molecular modalities to understand regulatory relationships. In the past, I developed [CellRank](https://cellrank.org), a framework to study cell fate decision making using multi-view single-cell data including gene expression and [RNA velocity](https://towardsdatascience.com/rna-velocity-the-cells-internal-compass-cf8d75bb2f89), as well as [moslin](https://github.com/theislab/moslin), a method to integrate gene expression with [lineage tracing data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-020-0223-2) across time points. You can learn more about my PhD work here: [Thesis]({{< ref "/content/thesis.md" >}} "My PhD thesis")

During my PhD, I visited the labs of [Dana Pe'er](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/dana-pe-er) at MSKCC and [Mor Nitzan](https://www.nitzanlab.com/) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for three months each, funded through an [Add-on Fellowship](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en/what-we-do/projects-for-understanding-science/interdisciplinary-networks-for-talented-young-scientists/add-on-fellowships-for-interdisciplinary-life-science/) by the Joachim Herz Foundation, the [Bayer Foundation](https://www.bayer-foundation.com/) and the [Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). I actively collaborate with these and other groups in my current work.
