Hi I'm Marius; I'm an applied mathematician working at the intersection of
machine learning and molecular biology. I have recently submitted my PhD in Computational Biology in the group of [Fabian Theis](https://twitter.com/fabian_theis) at [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/helmholtz-zentrum-muenchen/index.html)/[Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/).

I'm interested in understanding dynamical biological processes through the lens of single-cell genomics. To this end, I develop computational tools and apply them to solve biological questions
that arise in processes including development, regeneration and reprogramming. For example, I developed [CellRank](https://cellrank.org), a framework to study cell fate decision making using multi-view single-cell data including gene expression and [RNA velocity](https://towardsdatascience.com/rna-velocity-the-cells-internal-compass-cf8d75bb2f89).

During my PhD, I visited the labs of [Dana Pe'er](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/dana-pe-er) at MSKCC and [Mor Nitzan](https://www.nitzanlab.com/) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for three months each, funded through an [Add-on Fellowship](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en/what-we-do/projects-for-understanding-science/interdisciplinary-networks-for-talented-young-scientists/add-on-fellowships-for-interdisciplinary-life-science/) by the Joachim Herz Foundation, the [Bayer Foundation](https://www.bayer-foundation.com/) and the [Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). I actively collaborate with these and other groups in my current work.
