Hi I'm Marius; I'm an applied mathematician working at the intersection of
machine learning and molecular biology. I'm interested in understanding
dynamical biological processes through the lens of single-cell genomics. To this
end, I develop computational tools and apply them to solve biological questions
that arise in development, regeneration, reprogramming and cancer.
