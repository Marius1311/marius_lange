abstract: Simultaneous profiling of single-cell gene expression and lineage
  history holds enormous potential for studying cellular decision making.
  However, it is currently unclear how lineage and gene expression information
  across experimental time-points can be combined in destructive in-vivo
  sequencing experiments. Here we present moscot-lineage, a Fused
  Gromov-Wasserstein based model to couple cellular profiles across time-points.
  In contrast to existing methods, moscot-lineage combines intra-individual
  lineage relations with inter-individual gene expression similarity. We
  demonstrate on simulated and real data that moscot-lineage outperforms
  LineageOT, the only competing approach. Further, on C. elegans embryonic
  development, we show how moscot-lineage, combined with existing trajectory
  inference methods, predicts fate probabilities and putative decision driver
  genes.
