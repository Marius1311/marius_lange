abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has highlighted the important
  role of intercellular heterogeneity in phenotype variability in both health
  and disease1. However, current scRNA-seq approaches provide only a snapshot of
  gene expression and convey little information on the true temporal dynamics
  and stochastic nature of transcription. A further key limitation of scRNA-seq
  analysis is that the RNA profile of each individual cell can be analysed only
  once. Here we introduce single-cell, thiol-(SH)-linked alkylation of RNA for
  metabolic labelling sequencing (scSLAM-seq), which integrates metabolic RNA
  labelling2, biochemical nucleoside conversion3 and scRNA-seq to record
  transcriptional activity directly by differentiating between new and old RNA
  for thousands of genes per single cell. We use scSLAM-seq to study the onset
  of infection with lytic cytomegalovirus in single mouse fibroblasts. The
  cell-cycle state and dose of infection deduced from old RNA enable
  dose–response analysis based on new RNA. scSLAM-seq thereby both visualizes
  and explains differences in transcriptional activity at the single-cell level.
  Furthermore, it depicts ‘on–off’ switches and transcriptional burst kinetics
  in host gene expression with extensive gene-specific differences that
  correlate with promoter-intrinsic features (TBP–TATA-box interactions and DNA
  methylation). Thus, gene-specific, and not cell-specific, features explain the
  heterogeneity in transcriptomes between individual cells and the
  transcriptional response to perturbations.
