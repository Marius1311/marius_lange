title: "Moscot: A scalable toolbox for optimal transport problems in single-cell
  genomics"
abstract: Numerous problems in single-cell genomics have recently been
  approached using optimal transport (OT), a field of mathematics concerned with
  comparing probability distributions across spaces. These problems include
  mapping cells across timepoints, perturbations and experimental batches as
  well as reconstructing spatial structure from gene expression. Despite their
  successful applications, OT-based solutions face common challenges that hinder
  their community-wide adaptation including a fractured tools landscape, limited
  scalability and lacking support for multimodal data. To overcome these
  challenges, we present multimodal single-cell optimal transport tools
  (moscot), a Python package which implements OT-based solutions to common
  problems through a unified API that scales to large, multimodal datasets. In
  various applications, we demonstrate moscotâ€™s unified API and show how it
  scales to large datasets. For lineage-traced in-vivo time-series experiments,
  we present moscot-lineage which maps cells across time points by combining
  intra-individual lineage relations with inter-individual gene expression
  similarity. On C.elegans embryonic development, we show how moscot-lineage can
  be combined with CellRank to predict fate probabilities and putative decision
  driver genes.

This is a Models, Inference & Algorithms (MIA) talk at the Broad Institute jointly with Marco Cuturi; MIA talks consist of a primer and a seminar. While the primer gives background on the field, the seminar introduced one particular project with a focus on methodology. For more information, check out [MIA talks at the Broad](https://www.broadinstitute.org/talks/spring-2022/mia).

## Primer: From matchings to optimal transport, use cases and algorithms

I will provide in this primer a self-contained intro to optimal transport, a field at the intersection of maths, economics and machine learning. Motivated by recent applications to single cell genomics, I will start from the original optimal matching problem. Focusing next on the limitations of matchings, both in terms of modeling and computations, I will introduce several extensions and modifications of that original problem: first with the so-called Kantorovich formulation, to the introduction of regularizations that allow to compute, at very large scales, a generalized notion of matching that has practical relevance.
